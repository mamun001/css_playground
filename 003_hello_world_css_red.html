<!-- Comment: This has been tested. Works. Marks h1 as Red in line that starts with style. Thus, last line, which is h1, shows up as red when opened in Browser -->
<!-- Comment: Not sure if this can be called in-line CSS -->

<style type="text/css">
h1 {
	color: Red;
}
</style>

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
